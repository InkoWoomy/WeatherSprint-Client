Peer Review by zachdressing:
    //Code is fornmatted very well, everthing is labelled properly
    //Very good search function, however some values come up with odd results. Still really good (more accurate to the US than mine!)
    //Formatting of the page (css) is very accurate to my figma
    //Sunset time looks great and pulls up well, however its time is innacurate (timezones would be insane to code so not an issue)
    //Forecast looks accurate to my figma, and the code for it works pretty good! Just a little issue with the Min/Max values.
    //overall, Great!
